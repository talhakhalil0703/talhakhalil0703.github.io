              <h3>Audbile Clock</h3>
              <h4>Designed for visually imparied individuals, coded in C using the pic microcontroller</h4>
              <p>
                With a team of 3 people designed and brought into fruition an audible clock made for visually impaired individuals. I was incharge of the coding for the project which
                was done in C and created on a PIC micro controller (PIC16F1778). Time is obtained using system interrupts, and measured to be accurate using an oscilloscope. The
                filesystem was created by turning audio WAV files into RAW files and then into binary files. Which were then accessed through their addresses to be played. One of the
                more difficult parts of this project was RAM management, how this was done was by using just the bits needed for a variable, and to not use longer bits if not needed,
                to perform a lot of actions through arithmetic instead as there was only 2kB of data memory. And also by locking out the processor when an audio file was playing, as
                the buffer would soon be full causing a system crash, to still get accurate timing, system interrupts were used. To open this code base download the zip file and open
                it using MPLab.
